/*	jePose

	This object is a hierarchical set of attached joints.  The joints can have names.
	A 'jePose' keeps track of which children joints move in the hierarchy when a parent
	joint moves.  A jePose also remembers the position transform matrices for each joint.

	The jePose is set by applying a motion at a specific time.  This queries the motion
	to determine each joint's change and applies them to the hierarchy.  Each joint can
	then be queried for it's world transform (for drawing, etc.)

	Additional motions can modify or be blended into the pose.  A motion that describes 
	only a few joint changes can be applied to only those joints, or a motion can be
	blended with the current pose. 

	Something to watch for:  since setting the pose by applying a motion is powerful
	enough to resolve intentionally mismatched motion-pose sets, this can lead to 
	problems if the motion UNintentionally does not match the pose.  Use 
	jePose_MatchesjeMotionExactly() to test for an exact name-based match.
