jDesignerClassic7 2.7.0

Welcome to the jDesignerClassic7, the original Jet3D 2.7.0 world editor.  
jDesignerClassic7 is part of the the jStudioClassic7 suite of applications
for the Jet3D development enterprise.

Jet3D provides a unique real time 3D development environment. You build your world,
add your actors while the engine is running. There is no separate compilation
step. Jet3D gives the developer instant feedback so that you can see the effect
of your work without delay.

Developed by Eclipse Entertainment, Inc., Jet3D is being made available for
3D enthusiasts at no charge (license fees apply for commercial use). Use it
as a resource for learning, or use it for swift environmental prototyping.

At the time of its introduction (late 1999), Jet3D was in a class by itself.
Over the years, many members of the Jet3D community have continued to advance
the engine and its toolset. This release is a result of their hard work.

Jet3D continues to evolve. It remains a useful tool for rapid real
time 3D visualization.

Please direct your comments, suggestions for improvement, and bug reports to our 
forum accessible via www.jet3d.com.

Enjoy jDesignerClassic7...
